## Deployment

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

Once you have deployed the repository to your target org, navigate to your desired Lightning Page and use the gear wheel, then select `Edit Page`. Under `Custom`, drag and drop the `pdftronWebViewerDiffContainer` onto your desired Lightning Page, click `Save` and make sure the page is activated under `Activation`.
